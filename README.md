React-Native-Template
================================================
The goal of this project is to work as template for react-native applications, providing a base project structure, core dependencies and boilerplate to jumpstart development.

## Base dependencies
  - [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for networking.
  - [PropTypes](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types) to type-check our components exposed propperties.
  - [React-Native-Config](https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config) to manage envionments.
  - [React-Native-Navigation](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/#/) native navigation library.
  - [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management.
  - [Recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose) for utilities.
  - [Redux-Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) as persistance layer.
  - [Redux-Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) to dispatch asynchronous actions.
  - [Reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect) the selector library for redux.
  - [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) for testing.

## Usage

### Option #1: Using React-Native-Rename
You can start by cloning this repository and using [react-native-rename](https://github.com/junedomingo/react-native-rename). In the current state of this project, it should give you no issues at all, just run the script, delete your node modules and reinstall them and you should be good to go.

Keep in mind that this library can cause trouble if you are renaming a project that uses `Pods` on the iOS side.

After that you should proceed as with any javascript project:
- Go to your project's root folder and run `npm install`.
- Create a `.env` file to store all your configuration constants. Remember to not commit this file, since it can store sensible information of your product.
- Run `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android` to start your application!

### Option #2: Copy the structure to your project
If you want to roll on your own and don't want to use this as a template, you can create your own project and then copy the `/src` folder (which has all the code of your application) and update your `index.js`.

Keep in mind that if you do this, you'll have to **install and link** all dependencies (as well as adding all the necessary native code for each library that requires it).

## Folder sturcture
This template follows a very simple project structure:
- `src`: This folder is the main container of all the code inside your application.
  - `actions`: This folder contains all actions that can be dispatched to redux.
  - `assets`: Asset folder to store all images, vectors, etc.
  - `components`: Folder that contains all your application components.
    - `Common`: Folder to store any common component that you use through your app (such as a generic button, textfields, etc).
    - `MyComponent`: Each component should be stored inside it's own folder, and inside it a file for its code and a separate one for the styles. Then, the `index.js` is only used to export the final component that will be used on the app.
      - `MyComponent.js`
      - `styles.js`
      - `index.js`
  - `helpers`: Folder to store any kind of helper that you have.
  - `reducers`: This folder should have all your reducers, and expose the combined result using its `index.js`
  - `selectors`: Folder to store your selectors for each reducer.
  - `services`: Folder to store all your network services logic.
  - `App.js`: Main component that starts your whole app.
- `index.js`: Entry point of your application as per React-Native standards.

## Styleguide
For coding styling we decided to go with ESLint and [Airbnb's styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) with a few exceptions that you can find on the [.eslintrc.json](./.eslintrc.json)
